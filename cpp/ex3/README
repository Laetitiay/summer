# Question 1
 - For addition, we can see that both for both sets non-parallel runs faster than parallel.
   I guess the overhead for parallel computation is too big to be worth it for "small"
   computations.
 - For multipication, the non-parallel is faster on the small set but the parallel is much
   faster on the big set. 

# Question 2
 - Addition is much faster than multipication, in both parallel, non-parallel, big and small.
   Because addition is O(n^2) while multipication is O(n^3). Also multipication has a much better
   chance in utilizing parallel computation.
