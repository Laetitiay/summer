In this exercise we made a Convex Hull of some set of points 
and we also have the Point itself and a set of it, PointSet.
## Point
it has long x, long y as attributes.
## PointSet
It has an array of points that start at capacity 2. Every time we add
a new thing to the set, if the capacity == the size, we double up the size
in a multiple of two. We create a new array of that size and copy the previous 
array into it.
## ConvexHull
I implemented the algorithm from Wikipedia's article with a few changes.
I removed points with the same angle that were closer to the minimum points
because they were irrelevnt.
In wikipedia it says the complexity is O(n \log n) and I think that's pretty good.
